Welcome to Linux Web!

This is a version of Ubuntu made for the modern Web browser using ChatGPT, GitHub, and GitHub Codespaces as a part of a challenge.

If there are any issues please get in touch with me immediately and I will sort out the issue as soon as possible.

Enjoy!

btw if you want to use a VM I wouldn't suggest doing so as it may break your browser (and will and/or maybe kill a Chromebook)
